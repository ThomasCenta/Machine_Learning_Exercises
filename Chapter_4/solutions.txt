4.1) It needs to represent the function y = 2x+2 => y-2x-2 > 0
	w0 (the constant) = -2; w1 (x1 weight) = -2; w2 (y weight) = 1

4.2) a) can be represented by the function y = x-1 where A=x and B=y => y-x-1 > 0
	so w0=-1; w1 = -1; w2 = 1
     b) create four hidden units which each take the two inputs and design each one to be one of the four and statements: A^B, A^!B, !A^B, !A^!B
		then have each one output to o with weight one. 
4.3) True, everything classified as positive by the first will be classified as positive by the second due to the lower threshold.

4.4) This question is dumb since a single linear unit has serious trouble representing a single threshold perceptron. Im not going to bother
	making a dozen plots to show that. I will note however that the iterative trained faster but the batch had a lower error when after it troughed
